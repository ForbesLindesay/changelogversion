## Read Pull Request State

- check permissions
- get head sha & closed state from GitHub
- run "Update Commits From Head" - with small page size because it should already be up to date because of the events
- return `git_tags`, `change_log_entries` and `package_manifest_records`

## Read All Unreleased Changes

Input: package name, git tag of last release (or null if not released) & optional branch name

- check permissions
- run "Update Commits From Head" - with small page size because it should already be up to date because of the events
- recursively query all commits from head that are not reachable from the git tag
- join with pull requests -> change log entries (where package name matches)
- return change log entries

## Read package infos

Input: branch name or pull request

- check permissions
- run "Update Commits From Head" - with small page size because it should already be up to date because of the events
- return `package_manifest_records`

# Procedures

## Update Commits From Head

Input: Repo + Head Commit + page size (defaults to 100)

- read history commits from head commit, starting with the newest
  - if commit already in `git_commits`:
    - if "queue" is empty", break out of loop
    - else continue to next commit
  - add commit to `git_commits`
  - consume any records from "queue" that match this commit's sha in `parent_sha`
    - insert into `git_commit_parents`
  - read commit parents
    - if commit parent is in `git_commits`, insert into `git_commit_parents`
    - else add `[parent_sha, commit_id]` to "queue"
  - read the associated pull requets for the commit
    - run "Load Pull Request"
    - insert into `git_commit_pull_requests`
  - if "queue" is empty, break out of loop
- Commit Transaction
- if head commit's `has_package_manifests` is `false`:
  - fetch `package_manifest_records` for the head commit
  - insert into `package_manifest_records`
  - set `has_package_manifests` to `true` for head commit

## Update commits from tail

Input: Repo

- read history commits from head commit of default branch, starting with the oldest commit
  - inster into `git_commits`
  - insert parents into `git_commit_parents` - we are reading from oldest to newest, so we have already inserted the parent
  - read the associated pull requets for the commit
    - run "Load Pull Request"
    - insert into `git_commit_pull_requests`
- insert into `git_branches`

## Load Pull Request

Input: Pull Request ID

- if pull request alerady loaded, no-op
- read pull request (pr number, title, open/merged/closed)
- read comments
  - if comment contains state
  - write changes
