# Changelog Version

Add changelogs to PRs and use them to determine the version of npm packages

It has no state of its own. The changelog for each PR is stored along with the corresponding PR (in a comment). The CLI tool will require a GitHub API token to read the changelog, and write to releases. It will require an npm token to publish to npm.

## Commercial Use

Changelog Version is not free for comercial use. If you want to run your own version for commercial use, you can [buy a license](https://licensezero.com/offers/fd126855-9cba-457c-b444-db54f7a4f852). A hosted option is coming soon.

## Personal Open Source Use

Changelog Version is free for non-commercial open source use. Just [install the GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/changelog-version) and add the CLI to your CI process.
