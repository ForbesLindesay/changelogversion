# Changelog Version

Add changelogs to PRs and use them to determine the version of npm packages

It has no state of its own. The changelog for each PR is stored along with the corresponding PR (in a comment). The CLI tool will require a GitHub API token to read the changelog, and write to releases. It will require an npm token to publish to npm.
